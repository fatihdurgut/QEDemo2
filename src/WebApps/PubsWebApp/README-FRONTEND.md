### Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Angular 17+ (standalone components)
- **UI Library**: Angular Material
- **State Management**: NgRx (configured, integration in progress)
- **Real-time**: @microsoft/signalr (installed)
- **Charts**: Chart.js (installed)
- **PWA**: @angular/pwa with service worker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Angular CLI 17+

### Installation

```bash
cd src/WebApps/PubsWebApp
npm install
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload when you make changes.

### Environment Configuration

Two environment files are configured:
- `src/environments/environment.ts` - Development
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` - Production

Update API URLs to match your backend services:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrls: {
    identity: 'http://localhost:5007',
    authors: 'http://localhost:5001',
    publishers: 'http://localhost:5002',
    // ... other services
  }
};
```

## API Integration

### Backend Services

The frontend integrates with the following microservices:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Identity API | 5007 | Authentication and user management |
| Authors API | 5001 | Authors CRUD operations |
| Publishers API | 5002 | Publishers CRUD operations |
| Titles API | 5003 | Titles CRUD operations |
| Sales API | 5004 | Sales and orders management |
| Employees API | 5005 | Employee management |
| Notifications API | 5008 | Real-time notifications via SignalR |
| Analytics API | 5009 | Analytics and reporting |

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials via login form
2. AuthService sends request to Identity API
3. JWT token received and stored in localStorage
4. AuthInterceptor adds token to all subsequent requests
5. AuthGuard protects routes requiring authentication

## Roadmap

### Next Steps

1. **NgRx State Management** - Implement store, actions, reducers
2. **Complete CRUD Operations** - Finish all feature modules
3. **Real-time Notifications** - SignalR hub integration
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Sales charts and graphs
5. **Testing** - Unit tests for components and services
6. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance
